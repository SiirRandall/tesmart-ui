# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# This workflow lets you compile your Go project using a SLSA3 compliant builder.
# This workflow will generate a so-called "provenance" file describing the steps
# that were performed to generate the final binary.
# The project is an initiative of the OpenSSF (openssf.org) and is developed at
# https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator.
# The provenance file can be verified using https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier.
# For more information about SLSA and how it improves the supply-chain, visit slsa.dev.
